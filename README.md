This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `Bug.java` file contains code that throws this exception due to accessing an array element beyond its valid index.  The solution, provided in `BugSolution.java`, shows how to prevent this error by using a check before accessing the array element. This is a critical concept for writing robust and reliable Java code.
